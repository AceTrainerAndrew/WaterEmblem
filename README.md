Fire Emblem - Chronicles of the Abyss
=====================================

What is Fire Emblem?
--------------------

Fire Emblem is a Turn-Based Strategy Role Playing Game (TBSRPG), made by Nintendo and Intelligent Systems.
The whole draw of Fire Emblem is the ability for a player to control an army of units, thrown into a 
medival world overun by nations and demons bent on destroying the world. To this day, there are Fire 
Emblem games on various gaming consoles, but none that are web-based.

What is this game?
------------------

Fire Emblem - Chronicles of the Abyss is a web-based version of Fire Emblem - Blazing Sword for the Game
Boy Advanced (GBA), although with a different plot twist (and a different main character). This game is
built entirely in JavaScript (using the ImpactJS) Game Engine, purely for educational purposes under the
City College of New York chapter of Association for Computing Machinery's Game Development Club. On top
of that, this game is built for the sake of re-creating a well-loved game, as well as pushing the 
ImpactJS Game Engine to its limits.
